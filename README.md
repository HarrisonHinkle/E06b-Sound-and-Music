# E06b-Sound-and-Music

This was an assignment for my Game Technology Class at IU. The goal of this assignment was to experiment with adding music and sound files into Godot. In the Godot file found on this repository, I added 3 sound effects I made in Audacity and a short song made in MuseScore to be played when ran.
